This assignment is last asm_image, except freeform.

You have to write an image filter in assembly. 50% of your grade will be
technical difficulty, 50% will be on artistic merit. You can start with any
image you like, and I suggest crafting your filter code to match the image you
choose.

Upload the before and after onto Canvas. You can work with a partner on this
assignment, but then each of you will need to do a filter, and so upload all
three images (original, original + filter1, original + filter1 + filter2).
